# Thermal Analysis of Aluminum Rod Using Matlab
> OBJECTIVES

Observe and measure thermal waves in an aluminum rod by modulating the heating at one end. 

Compare experimental data with the expected values determined by the simulation:
From matching the simulation graph to the experimental, extract the thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and emissivity of the aluminum rod, as well as the fraction of power.

> EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

*Fig 1. Experimental setup to detect diffusive heat waves for aluminum rod. Five 4.58 mm diameter holes were drilled into the rod at approximately even intervals to accommodate the TMP35G sensors. A LT0 100 power resistor was snugly placed onto one face. The same rod is used throughout the experiment.*
